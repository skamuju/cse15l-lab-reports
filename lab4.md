  - In this screenshot, I log into my ieng6 machine, clone my fork of the git repository with the SSH link, and I type out the command to open up the file we need to fix.

  - When completing this lab, I accidentally fixed the file before taking a screenshot showing the tests did not run, so I had to go back, re-break the file, and then run the tests, which is why the screenshot isn't contiguous with the others.

* Step 7:

  - To fix this file, I simply changed index1 in the fourth line from the end to index2
  - To acheive this, I input <control>g, <shift>g, kkkkkk, e, x, i, 2, <escape>, :wq
  - This series of commands moved me to the end of the file, up to the line I wanted to edit, moved to the end of the word I wanted to edit, delete the 1, insert the 2 afer index, escape insert mode, and finally save and exit the file.
