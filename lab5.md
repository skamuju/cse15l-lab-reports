# Lab Report 5

* Part 1:
  - Student: I am having some issues with my grading bash script, and I am not sure why it isn't working. I keep getting an issue saying that ListExamples.java is not found, even though my `git clone` command successfully runs
  - TA: Can you show me a picture of your Terminal output and your script?
  - Student: Sure

  - TA: It seems like your script cannot find `ListExamples.java` from where it is working in. Maybe consider throwing in an `ls` command to see what your script is looking at when searching for `ListExamples.java`. Try that and get back to me with your output.
  - Student: I tried it and here is my output. I realized that my script is not operating in the right directory, so I added `cd grading area` right before I search for `ListExamples.java`, and removed the `ls` statement. My script seems to be working now!

  - TA: Good job and good luck on the rest of the assignment!
* Part 2:
  - During my CSE 15L lab section I had the pleasure of meeting several new people through working with them during class, and lots of new things from many different spheres of programming. One thing that I learned that stood out to me however, was how to use Vim. My main text editor is still VSCode but I found that Vim has been really helpful for certain situations that seem to pop up a lot when programming such as needing to create short scripts for tying together programs or making small changes here or there when programming. Especially after finding Vim tutot, I think I ended up spending a decent amount of time trying to get better at using Vim and how I can cut down the amount of time I spend working on something through various Vim macros.
