  - During my CSE 15L lab section I had the pleasure of meeting several new people through working with them during class, and lots of new things from many different spheres of programming. One thing that I learned that stood out to me however, was how to use Vim. My main text editor is still VSCode but I found that Vim has been really helpful for certain situations that seem to pop up a lot when programming such as needing to create short scripts for tying together programs or making small changes here or there when programming. Especially after finding Vim tutot, I think I ended up spending a decent amount of time trying to get better at using Vim and how I can cut down the amount of time I spend working on something through various Vim macros.
